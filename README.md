# NCEP FNL-GFS Data Analysis and Visualization Notebooks

Visualizing NCEP/GDAS' FNL Meteorological Dataset, core of GFS Model, 
at 0.25 x 0.25 degree. These dataset can be queried via NCAR/UCAR RDA (https://rda.ucar.edu/) or
direct to THREDDS Server (https://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog/catalog.html).

These notebooks that I created are used for my bachelor's thesis. However, it 
can be used, accordingly based on your preference i.e. location, time, etc. Thus, you can definitely
make improvements out of it.

These notebooks include synoptic and mesoscale (e.g. convective and kinematic) parameters.

I've used Python ver. 3.9.x and the python packages/dependencies mostly used in these notebooks are the following;

  - Cartopy,
  - Matplotlib,
  - MetPy (both 1.3 on Desktop and 1.5 on Laptop),
  - NumPy, and
  - Xarray

Make sure you have those!
